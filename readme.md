# Spectroscopy with He* BECs

This is a MATLAB suite for analysis of metrological data from the ANU He* lab, but should be flexible enough to streamline the build of future projects.


### Prerequisites

This code is written for MATLAB >= R2018a.
You'll need the [Core BEC analysis](https://github.com/brycehenson/Core_BEC_Analysis) library, which should be cloned into the same directory for ease of use.

### Installing

Clone into the directory of your choice, along with the required libraries.

### Getting started

The core program is main_scripts, which calls a series of functions to import, condition, and process data stored in our archive as comma-delimited .txt files. One day, this may become publically available.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome, if you happen to have any use for this code, by the usual fork/edit/pull request.

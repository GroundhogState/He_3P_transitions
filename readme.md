# TO DO BEFORE GIT

Software
* Import analog logs and implement checks: WM set point
* Better logging
	* figure exporting DONE
	* Generate metadata logfiles and export
* Fix time offset between LV and MCP logs DONE 
* Calibration model
	* Implemented, just needs control flow & safeties if no calibrations found
* Fitting
	* Implemented structurally, needs safeties & control flow
* generalize monitor run feature
* Better modular caching
	* smarter WM importing; timestamp sensitive?
	* Why does cache fail to import so often?
* Compile core import functions?

Hardware
* Desaturate signal
		* Lower optical power
				* Adjust set point
				* Expand beam
		* Higher init atom number
				* Visible with no evaporator?
* Narrower scan
* First estimate!
